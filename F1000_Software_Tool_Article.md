## Abstract
**Background:** Reproducible evidence-synthesis model development often requires repeated fitting, heterogeneity checks, and structured reporting outputs. Value Based HTA Engine was prepared to support these workflows in a traceable software package.

**Methods:** The project is implemented using R, HTML. The documented workflow covers data import, parameter selection, model execution, diagnostics, and export. The manuscript presents a reviewer-facing reproducibility path with explicit artifact pointers and bounded claims.

**Results:** The package supports end-to-end local workflows from input through model execution and exportable outputs, with validation evidence linked through project artifacts where available.

**Conclusions:** Value Based HTA Engine provides a practical workflow for transparent modeling and evidence synthesis; external submission readiness depends on final public repository metadata and DOI-archived release records.

## Introduction
Complex modeling projects can become difficult to audit when data handling, estimation, diagnostics, and reporting are separated across multiple ad hoc steps. This manuscript documents a consolidated workflow with reproducibility-first structure.

### Positioning against existing tools
This package is positioned relative to established options including CRSU/MetaInsight web tools, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), Stata-based workflows, and package-driven R pipelines. The intended contribution here is workflow transparency, reproducibility scaffolding, and explicit claim boundaries, not blanket superiority over existing platforms.

### Table 1. Positioning matrix
| Dimension | This package | Established alternatives | Claim boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary goal | Transparent, reproducible end-to-end workflow | Mature GUIs/statistical packages with broad legacy adoption | Scope limited to demonstrated workflows |
| User profile | Clinicians/researchers needing guided reproducibility | Advanced analysts and mixed-skill teams | Complementary use is recommended |
| Strength emphasis | Auditability, artifact linkage, structured outputs | Feature breadth and ecosystem maturity | Interpret strengths relative to use case |
| Reproducibility support | Walkthrough + validation summary + checklist | Varies by tool/package and setup | Claims remain artifact-bounded |

## Methods
### Implementation
The software package is organized for local execution with explicit analysis states and reproducible outputs. Components cover data handling, model settings, estimation routines, diagnostics, and export.

### Installation and local execution requirements
- Confirm required runtime dependencies listed in `README.md` and project environment files.
- Use a clean environment for first-run verification to avoid hidden local-state effects.
- Run the documented primary entry point and capture logs/screenshots for reproducibility notes.
- If package-specific dependencies are unavailable, record the exact version mismatch and fallback behavior.

### Operation
- Open and run one primary project entry point (e.g., `README.md`).
- Load demonstration or test data (example reference: ``f1000_artifacts\example_dataset.csv``).
- Configure default model and sensitivity settings, then execute analysis.
- Review outputs and export artifacts for independent verification.

### Table 2. Minimum input schema and validation checks
| Input field | Required | Validation rule | Failure risk if missing/invalid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Study identifier | Yes | Unique per row/group | Mislabelled outputs, merge errors |
| Effect/endpoint variables | Yes | Numeric + interpretable scale | Invalid model estimation |
| Uncertainty/count fields | Yes | Non-negative and non-null | Biased weighting or unstable inference |
| Model-setting metadata | Yes | Explicitly recorded at run time | Non-reproducible reruns |
| Source file provenance | Recommended | Track input path and version | Ambiguous audit trail |

### Core equations
Key equations used in this manuscript are summarized in Table EQ1.

### Equation summary table
| Eq. ID | Model component | Expression | Interpretation role |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | General model specification | `y_i = g(x_i; \theta) + u_i + \varepsilon_i` | Defines core model structure with parameterized signal and noise terms. |
| E2 | Random-effects variance structure | `u_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2),\; \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,v_i)` | Encodes heterogeneity and sampling variability assumptions. |
| E3 | Precision-weighted estimator | `\hat{\theta} = \frac{\sum_i w_i \theta_i}{\sum_i w_i},\; w_i = \frac{1}{v_i + \tau^2}` | Summarizes pooled effects under random-effects weighting. |

### Reproducibility and validation
The package is reported with explicit artifact references so claims can be independently checked.

#### Validation evidence table
| Validation dimension | Evidence summary | Artifact source |
|---|---|---|
| Local execution context | Project execution and output generation are documented for local reruns. | `README.md` |
| Validation scope | Validation, test, or benchmark artifacts were identified for package-level checking. | ``f1000_artifacts\validation_summary.md`` |
| Evidence policy | Claims are bounded to artifact-supported local outputs; no unsupported superiority claims are made. | `F1000_Submission_Checklist_RealReview.md` |
| Release requirements | Public repository URL and DOI archive are required before external submission. | `F1000_Submission_Checklist_RealReview.md` |

### Core functionality exposed in the package
- Data ingestion and preprocessing hooks
- Configurable modeling and sensitivity parameters
- Diagnostic and interpretive output pathways
- Exportable artifacts for reporting and reproducibility

### Reviewer-informed reproducibility safeguards
- End-to-end walkthrough included for independent rerun.
- Evidence statements tied to local artifact paths.
- Limitations and claim boundaries stated explicitly.
- Submission blockers clearly listed in checklist form.

### Output interpretation guidance
Interpret outputs jointly across effect estimates, uncertainty intervals, heterogeneity diagnostics, and sensitivity results. For small study counts, rare-event settings, or model-mismatch scenarios, treat asymmetry tests and pooled estimates cautiously. When assumptions are only approximately met (e.g., large-sample approximations), results should be reported with explicit caveats.

### Table 4. Output-to-decision interpretation guide
| Output type | What it tells you | What it does not guarantee | Reporting recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary pooled/model estimate | Central tendency under stated assumptions | Universal validity across all settings | Report with assumptions and uncertainty |
| Heterogeneity metrics | Between-study variability signal | Definitive cause of heterogeneity | Pair with subgroup/sensitivity rationale |
| Bias/asymmetry checks | Potential small-study/publication-bias signal | Definitive proof of bias mechanism | Report small-k limitations explicitly |
| Sensitivity analyses | Robustness under alternate assumptions | Immunity to all model misspecification | Present scenario-wise evidence table |

## Use cases
### Demonstration dataset used for manuscript walkthrough
- Dataset reference: ``f1000_artifacts\example_dataset.csv``
- Rationale: fixed demonstration artifacts improve reviewer reproducibility.

### Use case 1: Primary model execution
Workflow:
- Load demonstration data and run default model configuration.
- Review primary outputs and uncertainty diagnostics.
- Export results for reproducibility archive.

Expected outputs for manuscript:
- Primary estimate summary
- Diagnostics and model-status outputs
- Exportable reporting artifacts

### Use case 2: Sensitivity and robustness check
Workflow:
- Re-run with alternative settings (e.g., heterogeneity/sensitivity options).
- Compare directional and magnitude stability of key outputs.
- Document any materially different conclusions.

Expected outputs for manuscript:
- Sensitivity-aware interpretation
- Traceable robustness evidence

### Reviewer-facing walkthrough (replicable package check)
1. Run one documented entry point (e.g., `README.md`).
2. Load a demonstration/test dataset (e.g., ``f1000_artifacts\example_dataset.csv``).
3. Execute default analysis and record outputs.
4. Execute at least one sensitivity rerun and compare conclusions.
5. Cross-check outputs against listed validation evidence paths.

### User tutorial and onboarding
- Start with packaged demonstration data before using external data.
- Verify exported results against on-screen summaries.
- Use checklist items before submission or release tagging.
- Report warnings and convergence caveats with analysis outputs.

### Table 5. Assumptions, diagnostics, and caution flags
| Component | Assumption | Recommended diagnostic | Caution flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effect model | Chosen form reflects study design and outcome scale | Residual pattern + sensitivity reruns | Large directional shifts across settings |
| Heterogeneity handling | Random-effects assumptions are plausible | Tau/I2/Q-related diagnostics | Small-k instability or extreme heterogeneity |
| Approximation regime | Large-sample approximations adequate for data context | Rare-event and small-k checks | Sparse events / unstable variance |
| Sensitivity module | Alternative settings should not reverse core interpretation without explanation | Structured scenario comparison table | Inference changes without transparent rationale |

## Discussion
The primary strength is operational transparency: workflow steps, outputs, and evidence references are all documented in one package-level path. This improves reviewer auditability and reduces undocumented handoffs.

### Limitations and claim boundaries (review-informed)
- The package is not framed as a universal replacement for all existing methods/tools.
- Claims are restricted to artifact-supported local workflows.
- Interpretation quality remains dependent on methodological fit and data quality.
- Repository URL and DOI metadata are still required before submission.

## Conclusions
Value Based HTA Engine is structured for reproducible modeling workflows with explicit evidence mapping and bounded claims. With final repository/DOI metadata completed, the package is prepared for software-tool reporting.
